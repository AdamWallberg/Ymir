<h1 align="center">Ymir Engine</h1>
<h4 align="center">Another Game Engine, but Better</h4>

My n'th game engine that I named after my cat. Wohoo..<br>
The GitHub version of this project is a simple copy-pase remake of another private project under the same name.
So I actually already have a running version of this engine already, I just wanted it to have better architecture and
prettier code. So the development will be really quick up until I start dealing with (for example) more advanced rendering.

<h3>Implemented Features</h3>
  - Premake5 project setup <br>
  - GLFW context creation <br>
  - Multi-threaded state machine <br>
  - 32 and 64 bit windows support <br>
  - Slightly fancy logging <br>

<h3>Planned Features</h3>
  - Deferred lighting, instancing, skeletal animations, fancy postFX, etc... <br>
  - Maybe even PBR <br>
  - Memory tracking <br>
  - Custom block allocator <br>
  - Crème Fraîshe
